# SER-using-MLP-and-CNN
Speech emotion recognition using MLP(logistic accuracy) and CNN on four benchmark datasets RAVDESS SAVEE TESS and EmoDB.
We have implemented mlp and cnn for effective speech emotion recognition using a combination of mfcc melspectrogram chromagram zero crossing rate and root mean square energy features.
Total feature set size = 182.

Accuracy results:-

EmoDB       MLP=69.16%      CNN=72.89

RAVDESS     MLP=70.49%      CNN= 61.11

SAVEE       MLP=76.04%      CNN=70.83

TESS        MLP=99.93%      CNN=99.35
